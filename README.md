# Sophos-API-Programs
This is a repository for programs I wrote to automate Sophos API calls/functions. Seemed neater.

These are scripts I wrote to call the Sophos API and transfer endpoints from one Tenant to another. DO NOT USE THIS CODE. I have intentionally mangled it so
that I can recompile them together into a useful program with a GUI. I have no idea how these programs would even be useful in their current state but its possible
they may damage your Sophos tenants if used as is.
